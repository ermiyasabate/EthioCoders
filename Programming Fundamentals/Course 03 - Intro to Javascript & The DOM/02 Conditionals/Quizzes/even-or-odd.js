/*
 * QUIZ REQUIREMENTS
 * 1. Your code should have a variable `number`, and include an `if...else` statement
 * 2. Your conditional should use a strict comparison (`===` or `!==`), and use the modulo ( `%` ) operator
 * 3. Your code should produce the expected output - "even" or "odd" using console.log() method
 */
 
 
// change the value of `number` to test your if...else statement
const number = 2;

// your code goes here
if (number % 2 === 0) {
    console.log(number + " is even!")
} else {
    console.log(number + " is odd!")
}

My HTML notes.

Markup in <em>HTML</em> refers to the way we annotate or “tag” content within an HTML document.These tags serve as
instructions to web browsers, telling them how to display the text, images, and other elements on a webpage. Think of it
as a set of guidelines that dictate the structure and presentation of your content.
